## Lecture 1

### `intervalscheduling.py`

This progrsm covers interval scheduling, an optimization problem where a
service attempts to complete as many tasks as possible in a given window
given that it can only perform one task at once. It also has a dynamic
programming algorithm for finding the optimal schedule if each job has a
given weight.

algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points in 2D space.
It compares the runtime of both algorithms as well.

### `median.py`

This program contains a linear-time divide-and-conquer rank algorithm
which, given a list of comparable objects, finds the object of rank
`i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to the length of the list minus 1).

which is used for an efficient polynomial multiplication algorithm.

in `O(log(log(N)))` time.

definition.

## Lecture 6

verification in `O(N ** 2)` time where `N` is the sidelength of the square matrices
