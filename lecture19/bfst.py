Lecture 19: Synchronized Distributed Algorithms
Breadth-First Spanning Tree
---------------------------
This lecture is the first on distributed algorithms,
algorithms which are executed on a network of machines
or processors that store memory.

For simplicity, the algorithm implementations in this
repo for synchronous distributed algorithms will be
executed on a single processor using a set of custom
classes meant to mock a network of machines.

This program covers a distributed algorithm for
computing the spanning-tree of a synchronized
distributed network. The algorithm starts at a
designated node in the network, then it does
a breadth-first search for unvisited nodes and
sets their parent pointers.

  Breadth-First Spanning Tree algorithm

  The first round of the algorithm, the source
  node (root of the tree) sends a "search" message
  to each of its channels. Each node is sends a
  "is parent" response to the source vertex, marks
  itself as "visited" and "searching" and
  the algorithm continues to the next round

  For each subsequent round, the nodes marked as
  "searching" sends a "search" message to their
  neighbors and the neighbors handle the "search"
  message the same way as the nodes in the first
  round.

  This algorithm continues until it reaches only
  leaf nodes. Leaf nodes are nodes that send "search"
  messages and after collecting "is parent" responses
  is not a parent to any node. They then instruct
  their parents to propagate a "done" message up the
  parent pointer chain until the source node is marked
  as "done".

  Number of messages per round: O(V + E) = O(n ** 2)
  Number of rounds for algo: O(V) = O(n)
