Lecture 17: Approximation Algorithms
Set Cover
---------

Given a set X and a family of subsets S_1, S_2, ..., S_n,
find the smallest collection of subsets such that their
union is equal to all of X.

This program contains an approximation algorith which finds
a set cover by selecting the largest subset, then removing
all elements in this subset from X and all the other subsets.

This algorithm is a (1 + log(n))-approximation algorithm and
is not guaranteed to produce an optimal solution.
