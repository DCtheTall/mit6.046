Simplex Algorithm
-----------------
The simplex algorithm is a linear programming (LP)
solver. See lingprog.py for a description of linear
programming.

In this case, given a vector

c in R^n

we are trying to find a vector

x in R^n where x[i] >= 0

which maximizes the dot product of x and c given
the constraints that

A * x <= b

where

b in R^m

and

A in R^(m x n)

i.e. in the set of all matrices with m rows and n columns.
The goal of simplex is to maximize the quantity

z = sum(c[i] * x[i] for i in range(n)).

In order to do so, we define the "basic" variables

x_b = [
  b_ub[j] - sum(A_ub[j][i] * x[i] for i in range(n))
  for j in range(m)
]

From the provided constraints, we see that each x[j] >= 0.

Let X_b be an m x m diagonal matrix where each element in the
diagonal is

X_b[i][i] = x_b[i].

This allows us to construct the initial tableau

| -c^T  0_m^T     1     0 |
| A_ub    X_b   0_m  b_ub |

where 0_m is the 0 vector in m dimensional space.
The resulting tableau is stored as a 2 dimensional
matrix using the SimplexTableau class.

We then iterate over this data structure using a
pivot step until an optimal solution is found.

Each pivot step is executed in 4 distinct actions:

1. Pivot column selection:

Select the column (pivot_j) in those first n + m
columns which has the smallest negative element
in the first row.

The first n + m columns of the first row represent
the coefficients of each of the variables in the objective
function.

The selected column is the non-basic variable
with the most "leverage" on the objective function.

2. Pivot row selection:

Select the row pivot_i in the tableau matrix T such that

T[pivot_i][pivot_j] = min(
  T[i][-1] / T[i][pivot_j]
  for i in range(1, n + m)
)

This row represents the "tightest" constraint on the
selected column variable because

T[i][-1] / T[i][pivot_j]

is the maximum value of that variable it can be
if all others are set to 0 without violating the
constraint.

3. Row reduction:

Multiply each element in the selected pivot row by the
reciprocal of chosen pivot element, i.e.

T[pivot_i][pivot_j].

The pivot element is now 1.

4. Variable elimination:

For each row i except for the selected pivot row,
select the element in the pivot_j

el = T[i][pivot_j]

and add the pivot row times the additive
inverse of el. This way afterwards

T[i][pivot_j] = 0.
