Lecture 14: Incremental Improvement
-----------------------------------
This lecture extends the material covered
in lecture 13 on flow networks and the
Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. This program is an
implementation of an example at the end of
lecture: seeing if a particular baseball team
can possibly win their division given the
current standings.
