Lecture 19: Synchronized Distributed Algorithms
Bellman-Ford Shortest Path Algorithm
------------------------------------
This lecture is the first on distributed algorithms,
algorithms which are executed on a network of machines
or processors that store memory.

For simplicity, the algorithm implementations in this
repo for synchronous distributed algorithms will be
executed on a single processor using a set of custom
classes meant to mock a network of machines.

This program covers the Bellman-Ford shortest path
distributed algorithm. Let's say we are given a network
of nodes which can communicate through channels,
each with a non-negative cost associated with sending
a message. The goal of the algoirthm is to find the lowest
possible cost it takes to send a message from a provided
source vertex to each node in the network.

The Bellman-Ford algorithm achieves this by having each
pair of connected nodes, u and v, send their urrent distance
(i.e. the cost of sending a message from the source to said
vertex) to each other, and for both vertices

if d(s, u) > d(s, v) + w(v, u) (variables can be interchanged)

then we set node u's "distance" to from s to be

d(s, v) + w(v, u)

this process is called relaxing the edges in the graph
from the source vertex s to u.

The network sends n rounds of messages (recall n = |V|
if the network is the graph G(V, E)) and by the
end, each node's "distance" will be minimized.
