Lecture 19: Synchronous Distributed Algorithms
Leader Election
---------------
This lecture is the first on distributed algorithms,
algorithms which are executed on a network of machines
or processors that store memory.

For simplicity, the algorithm implementations in this
repo for synchronous distributed algorithms will be
executed on a single processor using a set of custom
classes meant to mock a network of machines.

This program covers leader election, a simple distributed
algorithm where a network of nodes select a leader. In
this case, the nodes are represented using a complete,
undirected graph, called a clique network.

This program covers two methods for selecting a leader
in a complete network of nodes:

1. A deterministic algorithm for selecting a leader in a
  clique network of nodes with unique ids. Each node in
  the netowrk already has a unique id. Each node in the
  network sends each other their ids, and the node with
  the maximum id outputs LEADER, the rest output FOLLOWER.

2. A probabilistic algorithm for selecting a leader in a
  clique network of nodes with no unique ids, instead each
  id is assigned randomly such that there is a high probability
  that no two nodes share an id, and a leader is selected
  using the same process as the deterministic algorithm. If
  two nodes were randomly assigned the same maximum id, then
  the algorithm reassigns ids and continues until a maximum
  id is found.
