Optimal BST structure
---------------------

Let's say we have a set of n keys to insert into a binary
search tree and each key, k_0, k_1, ..., k_i, ..., k_(n - 1) has an associated
search probability w_i.

We want to construct the "optimal" binary search tree where
the cost function:

e(T) = sum([
  depth(k_i in T) * w_i
  for i in range(n)
])

where T is the tree.
