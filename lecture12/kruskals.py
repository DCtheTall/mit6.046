"""
Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree
Algorithm
---------

Kruskal's algorithm creates a minimum spanning tree (MST)
by sorting the edges by weight in descending order in a list,
and initializing a disjoint-set data structure containing all
vertices in singletons.

While the list is not empty, pop the last element in
the list, the edge with the least weight left.

If the vertices in the edge are not in the same set in the
disjoint-set, concatenate their sets and add that edge to
the MST.
