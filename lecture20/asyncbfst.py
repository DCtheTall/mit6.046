Lecture 20: Asynchronous Distributed Algorithms
Asynchronous Breadth-First Spanning Tree
----------------------------------------
This program covers an asynchronous algorithm
for find a spanning tree of a network of nodes.
The model for the asynchronous network is covered
in lecture20/asyncleaderelection.py.

The algorithm starts by selecting a root node for
the tree, and have that node enqueue a message
in each of its channels.

Afterwards, each time a node receives a message
and it has not yet been visited, it stores its
distance from the root, its parent, and then
emits a message across all of its channels.

The algorithm converges when there are no
more messages left in any channel's queue.
