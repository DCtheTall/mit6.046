"""
Lecture 22: Encryption
RSA Algorithm
-------------
RSA is a form of asymmetric-key cryptography. Let us say
Alice wants to receive messages from Bob.

Alice chooses two prime integers, p, q, and computes

N = p * q.

Alice chooses an integer, e, s.t.

1 < e < N and gcd(e, (p - 1) * (q - 1)) = 1.

Alice publishes (N, e) so that Bob can encrypt
messages by computing

c = (m ** e) % N

where m is the message, an integer coprime to
p and q. Bob sends the ciphertext, c, to Alice.

Alice is able to decrypt messages by computing an
integer, d, such that

d * e = 1 + k * ((p - 1) * (q - 1))

where k is a non-negative integer. Alice can decrypt
a encrypted message, c, using

m = (c ** d) % N.

The security of this cryptosystem comes from the fact
that for large p and q, it is computationally difficult to
factor N = p * q. Without knowing p and q, the decryption
exponent, d, is also computationally difficult to compute,
even with knowledge of N and e.
