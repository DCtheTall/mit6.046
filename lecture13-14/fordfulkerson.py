Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm
------------------------
Below is an implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
for finding the maximum possible flow through a flow network
G(V, E) using a mathematical structure called a residual network
G_f(V, E_f) which is discussed in flownetwork.py

The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm traverses the residual network using
BFS to find a path from the source to the sink. If a path exists,
then the maximum flow has not been reached, and we should increase the
flow with the minimum residual capacity available on that path.

Once a path is not longer available from the source to the sink along
the residual network, we know that the maximum allowable flow is
being sent through the network.
