"""
Augmented B-Tree: Insertion
---------------------------
This folder contains an implementation of an augmented B-tree.
For this implementation, the tree only stores data in its leaf
nodes. Each node also has level-set pointers defined here which
access the left and right siblings of each node (or None if they do not exist).
Each node also has a min/max key which store the minimum and maximum values
stored in the node or its children if it's not a leaf.

This implementation is optimized for finger-searching, i.e. finding a particular
value starting at a given node

This program covers methods for each node used for inserting keys
